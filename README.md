# Usage example
Below are some examples of how to use the `many` CLI.

## Retrieve the MANY ID of a key
```shell
# Generate a new Ed25519 key
$ openssl genpkey -algorithm Ed25519 -out id1.pem

# Print the MANY ID of the key
$ ./target/debug/many id id1.pem
mafdzlw6ktmpncikho6wwswzej7rpja7fgtbn33xzwkfngdygc
```

## Retrieve the status of a running MANY server
```shell
$ ./target/debug/many message --server https://alberto.app/api 'status' '{}'
