Feature: Mint token

@tokens
Scenario: Mint new tokens as token identity
	Given a default token owned by myself
	And a distribution of 1000 tokens to id 10
	And a distribution of 250 tokens to id 11
	And a memo "Foobar"
	When I mint the tokens as token identity
	Then id 1 has 123 tokens
	And id 2 has 456 tokens
	And id 3 has 789 tokens
	And id 10 has 1000 tokens
	And id 11 has 250 tokens
	And myself has 0 tokens
	And the circulating supply is 2618 tokens
	And the total supply is 2618 tokens
	And the memo is "Foobar"

@tokens
Scenario: Mint new tokens as random/anonymous, token owner present
	Given a default token owned by myself
	And a distribution of 1000 tokens to id 10
	And a distribution of 250 tokens to id 11
	Then minting as random fails with invalid sender
	Then minting as anonymous fails with invalid sender
	Then id 1 has 123 tokens
	And id 2 has 456 tokens
	And id 3 has 789 tokens
	And the circulating supply is 1368 tokens
	And the total supply is 1368 tokens

@tokens
Scenario: Mint new tokens as random/anonymous, token owner absent
	Given a default token owned by no one
	And a distribution of 1000 tokens to id 10
	And a distribution of 250 tokens to id 11
	Then minting as random fails with no token owner
	Then minting as anonymous fails with no token owner
	Then id 1 has 123 tokens
	And id 2 has 456 tokens
	And id 3 has 789 tokens
	And the circulating supply is 1368 tokens
	And the total supply is 1368 tokens

@tokens
Scenario: Mint new tokens as token owner
	Given a default token owned by myself
	And a distribution of 1000 tokens to id 10
	And a distribution of 250 tokens to id 11
	And a memo "Foobar"
	When I mint the tokens as myself
	Then id 1 has 123 tokens
	And id 2 has 456 tokens
	And id 3 has 789 tokens
	And id 10 has 1000 tokens
	And id 11 has 250 tokens
	And myself has 0 tokens
	And the circulating supply is 2618 tokens
	And the total supply is 2618 tokens
	And the memo is "Foobar"

@tokens
Scenario: Unable to mint zero
	Given a default token owned by myself
	And a distribution of 0 tokens to id 10
	Then minting as token identity fails with unable to distribute zero
	And the error address is id 10
	Then id 1 has 123 tokens
	And id 2 has 456 tokens
	And id 3 has 789 tokens
	And the circulating supply is 1368 tokens
	And the total supply is 1368 tokens

@tokens
Scenario: Mint more than maximum supply
	Given a default token owned by myself
	And a distribution of 99998633 tokens to id 10
	Then minting as token identity fails with over maximum
	Then id 1 has 123 tokens
	And id 2 has 456 tokens
	And id 3 has 789 tokens
	And the circulating supply is 1368 tokens
	And the total supply is 1368 tokens

@tokens
Scenario: Mint the maximum supply
	Given a default token owned by myself
	And a distribution of 99998632 tokens to id 10
	When I mint the tokens as token identity
	Then id 1 has 123 tokens
	And id 2 has 456 tokens
	And id 3 has 789 tokens
	And id 10 has 99998632 tokens
	And the circulating supply is 100000000 tokens
	And the total supply is 100000000 tokens

@tokens
Scenario: Unlimited maximum supply
	Given a default token of unlimited supply owned by myself
	And a distribution of 100000000 tokens to id 10
	When I mint the tokens as token identity
	Then id 1 has 123 tokens
	And id 2 has 456 tokens
	And id 3 has 789 tokens
	And id 10 has 100000000 tokens
	And the circulating supply is 100001368 tokens
	And the total supply is 100001368 tokens
