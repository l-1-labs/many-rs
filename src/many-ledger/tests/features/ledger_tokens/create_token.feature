	Given a ticker ABCDEF
	And a name Foobar
	And a decimals of 9
	Then creating the token as myself fails with invalid ticker length

@tokens
Scenario: Shortest token ticker allowed

	And a name Foobar
	And a decimals of 9

	Then the token symbol is a subresource
	And the token ticker is ABC
	And the token name is Foobar

@tokens
Scenario: Longest token ticker allowed
	Given a ticker ABCDE
	And a name Foobar
	And a decimals of 9
	When the token is created as myself
	Then the token symbol is a subresource
	And the token ticker is ABCDE
	And the token name is Foobar

@tokens
Scenario: Creating a new token, sender is myself, token owner is random
	Given random as owner
	Then creating the token as myself fails with unauthorized

@tokens
Scenario: Creating a new token, sender is myself, token owner is anonymous
	Given anonymous as owner
	Then creating the token as myself fails with unauthorized

@tokens
Scenario: Creating a new token, sender is anon/random, token owner is myself
	Given myself as owner
	Then creating the token as anonymous fails with unauthorized
	Then creating the token as random fails with unauthorized

@tokens
Scenario: Creating a new token, sender is myself, token owner is account I'm not part of
	Given a token account
	And id 5 as the account owner
	And setting the account as the owner
	Then creating the token as myself fails with missing permission
	And the error role is canTokensCreate

@tokens
Scenario: Creating a new token, sender is myself, token owner is account I'm the owner of
	Given a token account
	And myself as the account owner
	And setting the account as the owner
	And a ticker FBR
	When the token is created as myself
	Then the token owner is the account

@tokens
Scenario: Creating a new token, sender is some id, token owner is account where some id is part of and with token creation permission
	Given a token account
	And id 5 has token creation permission
	And setting the account as the owner
	And a ticker FBR
	When the token is created as id 5
	Then the token owner is the account

@tokens
Scenario: Creating a new token, sender is some id, token owner is account where some id is part of without token creation permission
	Given a token account
	And id 6 has token mint permission
	And setting the account as the owner
	Then creating the token as id 6 fails with missing permission
	And the error role is canTokensCreate

@tokens
Scenario: Creating a new token without owner (owner is sender)
	Given a ticker FOO
	And no owner
	When the token is created as myself
	Then the token ticker is FOO
	And the token owner is myself

@tokens
Scenario: Creating a new token, removing the owner
	Given a ticker FOO
	And removing the owner
	When the token is created as myself
